            Albert Einstein, a towering figure in modern physics, revolutionized
            our understanding of the universe with his theory of relativity,
            E=mc^2, which equated mass with energy. His work laid the foundation
            for advancements in nuclear physics and cosmology, earning him the
            Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Beyond his scientific contributions,
            Einstein's legacy endures as a symbol of intellectual curiosity,
            creativity, and humanitarianism.

            The Theory of General Relativity. Einstein's groundbreaking theory,
            published in 1915, revolutionized our understanding of gravity by
            describing how mass and energy warp the fabric of space-time.

          <p class="subtext">
            In 1905, Einstein introduced his Special Theory of Relativity, which
            fundamentally changed concepts of space and time, proposing that
            they are not absolute but are instead relative to the observer's
            motion.

            Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect, for which he
            received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, demonstrated the
            particle-like nature of light and laid the groundwork for the
            development of quantum theory.

            Perhaps his most famous equation, E=mc^2, demonstrates the
            equivalence of mass and energy, fundamentally altering our
            understanding of the relationship between matter and energy.
