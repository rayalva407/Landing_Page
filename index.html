          <p class="sec-text">
            Albert Einstein, a towering figure in modern physics, revolutionized our understanding of the universe with his theory of relativity, E=mc^2, which equated mass with energy. 
            His work laid the foundation for advancements in nuclear physics and cosmology, earning him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. 
            Beyond his scientific contributions, Einstein's legacy endures as a symbol of intellectual curiosity, creativity, and humanitarianism.
